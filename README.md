## Overview

This repository will include installation resources to deploy the full Zenko
stack over different orchestration systems.

We started with [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) but others
like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) will follow.

The stack is composed of:
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/),
- [Scality S3 server](https://github.com/scality/S3),
- [data and metadata deamon (dmd)](http://s3-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ARCHITECTURE/#data-metadata-daemon-architecture-and-operational-guide),
- [redis](https://redis.io/)
- all magically configured to talk to each other.
